# Iterative-Style-Transfer
Instead of using only two images to transfer style, this script will use Neural Style Transfer to combine a group of images into one image

# How To Use
1.create a new folder in the google colab notebook called styleTransfer

2.drag all the images you would like to combine into the folder

3.select one image to be your base/ starting image and rename it to "Transfer0.jpg"

4.drag this renamed image out of the folder and into the general file section of google colab

5.run the block of code at the bottom to add the image names to a list

6.now, either move all the photos out of the folder and into the general google colab file section, or drag your photos from finder/file explorer into the general google colab file section

7.now, you are ready to run the first block of code and visualize computer generated abstract art

8.new files will appear in the google colab file section labeled "TransferX.jpg" where X denotes the iteration count

9.By clicking on these files you can see the pictures created on each iteration
